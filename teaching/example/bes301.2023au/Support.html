	<h3>Academic resources</h3>
	<p>You receive W (writing) credit for completing this course. A W course requires that you write and revise 10-15 pages. Your final project is that long, and you will receive feedback from your peers and from me  to help you improve your writing—you’ll learn a lot both by conducting your own reviews and by reading other people’s comments on your work. I  encourage you to make use of the free resources at the Writing and Communication Center (WaCC). Check out the course calendar on Canvas, and schedule visits or online-meetings with peer consultants before drafts of different sections of your paper are due. The WaCC can also help you understand the primary literature you are reading.</p>
	<p>There is also a significant quantitative component of this course; we will be working with numbers. Everyone will complete their own work, but help each other! I also encourage you to make use of the campus resources available to you in the Quantitative Skills Center. It is a free, drop-in center with tutors trained to help students understand the concepts behind the numbers and build confidence in solving quantitative problems. You can find times when tutors are available for the concepts we will use in this course in the online schedule.</p>

	<h4>Navigate</h3>
	<p>There are many registration <a href="https://www.uwb.edu/academic-calendar/2023-2024-academic-calendar/registration-deadlines-2023-2024">deadlines</a> that come quickly during the quarter--for instance, a decision to drop a class. As your professor, part of my job is to communicate any concerns I may have about your academic performance to your advisors to connect you with support resources before it is too late. UW Bothell uses the Navigate Student Success Management system to allow me to share such feedback with your advisors should I feel such communication is needed. In addition, your advisors may request that I submit a progress report on your behalf. These communications remain confidential between me and your advisors, and will provide them up-to-date information related to your assignments, academic progress, and participation. Using Navigate to alert advisors about your academic progress will both help advising staff to know when you might need support and will prompt me to reflect on your work and make me think about what I can do to help you succeed in this class and at UW Bothell.</p>

	<p> Dr. Price acknowledges that we live and work on the unceded, ancestral lands of indigenous people. For example, the UWB campus sits on the original territory belonging to the Willow (Sammamish) People. Let us thank them for the stewardship of this land. Let us pay our respects to elders past and present.</p>
