		<h3>The nature of a hybrid course</h3>
		<p>Hybrid courses combine face-to-face meetings with extensive learning opportunities orchestrated through the course website. This course is 50% hybrid, meaning that class meets in person only once a week, and that you have more homework to complete. Our face-to-face meetings will help you succeed in this course. Active participation in both the face-to-face and online activities is required.</p>
		<p>Hybrid courses require more time doing assignments than courses that are completely face-to-face. To succeed, you should:</p>
			<ul type=square>
			<li>organize your time well.</li>
			<li>schedule times to work on class material, making good use of the <a href="https://www.uwb.edu/it/training-and-support/teaching-learning/open-learning-lab">Open Learning Lab</a>, the <a href="https://www.uwb.edu/academic-support-programs/qsc">Quantitative Skills Center</a>, and the <a href="https://www.uwb.edu/academic-support-programs/wacc">Writing and Communication Center</a>. You may find it helpful to find a group of people with whom to work weekly—either in person or remotely at one of these centers, or working together remotely through a platform like Zoom.</li>
			<li>be prepared to read and write a lot, especially in an online setting.</li>
			<li>be comfortable with using the Internet, email, and various software applications.</li>
			<li>have easy access to computers and fast-speed Internet.</li>
			<li>be willing to discuss and interact with others online.</li>
			<li>be self-motivated enough to finish assignments on deadline with little to no supervision.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Our face-to-face class sessions help you complete the activities in the course. You are responsible for any material presented or announced in class sessions. If you miss a class, you can catch up on the material from our class notes and by watching the video.  Please pay attention to course announcements. If you have questions about material you may have missed you can see me during office hours or schedule an appointment.</p>
		<h3>In the Classroom</h3>
		<p>Please bring your curiosity to class and be prepared to work. Class meetings are workshops designed to help you complete your assignments. During class meetings, I encourage you to ask questions and participate in discussion. During collaborative time, as you work in groups on analyzing and interpreting data, let's aim for a quiet and conversational working environment.</p>
		<h3>Zoom attendance</h3>
		<p>Sometimes, students cannot make it to class in person and can Zoom to class instead. Zoom links will be provided on campus. Please complete the <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1675336/assignments/8698475">Zoom attendance pledge </a>if you'd like to attend class this way. Taking that pledge is required for online attendance.</p>
		<h3>Online etiquette</h3>
		<p>As you know, it’s easy to miscommunicate online. In this class, we’ll adopt the following netiquette policies (adapted from Madison College) to minimize miscommunication and foster a respectful and supportive online environment.</p>
			<ul type=square>
			<li><i>Respect. </i>Respect each other’s background, feelings and opinions.</li>
			<li><i>Talk gently. </i>It’s easy to be abrupt, and unintentionally hurt someone’s feelings when writing. So, talk without strong language. Try not to be sarcastic or funny, as these are easy to misinterpret. If you’re writing something that is emotionally charged, start by writing a draft, let it sit for a while, and re-read a few hours later to make sure the tone is appropriate. Send it only after you are sure it is courteous.</li>
			<li><i>Allow for mistakes. </i>Despite best intentions, sometimes you might be hurt by something that someone in the course says. Please talk to the instructor about this, as she can help resolve the conflicts. Remember that usually—but certainly not always—the writer does not intend to be hurtful.</li>
			<li><i>Respect privacy. </i>Please don’t share people’s work or email messages. What happens in this class, stays in this class.</li>
			<li><i>Write well. </i>Be clear and concise, use good spelling and grammar. Stay on topic. To check clarity, read your message aloud to yourself before sending it.</li>
			<li><i>Read thoroughly before you write. </i>Read other people’s comments before making your own.</li>
			<li><i>Responding to a previous message. </i>Post comments under that message in the string to keep related topics organized. Specify the person and the particular point you are commenting on.</li>
			<li><i>Conventions. </i>Avoid caps, exclamation points, acronyms (wrt, btw, b/c, etc) and emojis.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The University and Zoom have FERPA-compliant agreements in place to protect the security and privacy of UW Zoom accounts. Students who do not wish to be recorded should (1) change their Zoom screen name to hide any personal identifying information such as their name or UW Net ID, (2) not share their computer audio or video if they are joining class by Zoom.</p>
		<h3>Academic integrity</h3>
		<p>Please see the UW Bothell General Catalog, the documents you signed upon admission to IAS for policy statements and crucial information regarding academic integrity. You are responsible for knowing what constitutes a violation of the University of Washington Student Code, and you will be held responsible for whether they were intentional or not. For crucial information regarding academic integrity, see the <a href="https://guides.lib.uw.edu/bothell/ai">library guide about plagiarism</a> and information from <a href="https://www.uwb.edu/student-affairs/studentconduct/student-guide">student affairs</a>. Make sure you know how to properly cite any ideas or words you have taken from outside sources.</p>
		<p>Work of any kind (including written, video, audio, performance, artistic, etc.) produced outside of this course may not be submitted for credit without first discussing it with your instructor.  In most circumstances, work produced for one course may not be submitted for another course.</p>
		<p>In plain language, this means that you should not plagiarize. Plagiarism will result in a grade of zero for the assignment in question, and may even result in a grade of zero for the entire course.</p>
		<h3>Respect for diversity</h3>
		<p>I expect students to respect individual differences that may include race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, age, cultural background, differences in ability, ethnicity, family status, gender presentation, immigration status, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and veteran status, etc. In this class, as in others, please engage respectfully in discussion of diverse worldviews and ideologies embedded in course readings, presentations, and artifacts, including those course materials that are at odds with personal beliefs and values. Any behaviors that are intolerant, disrespectful, threatening or otherwise disruptive are absolutely prohibited. Students who make it difficult for others to learn in a positive, and supportive environment will be asked to leave the class. See the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/cssc/for-students/student-code-of-conduct/">UW conduct code</a>.</p>		
		<h3>Religious Accommodation</h3>
		<p>Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW's policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at <a href="https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/"> Religious Accommodations Policy</a>. Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the <a href="https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/">Religious Accommodations Request form</a>.</p>
		<h3>Access and accommodations</h3>
		<p>Your experience in this class is important to me. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/">activate your accommodations via myDRS</a> so we can discuss how they will be implemented in this course.</p>
		<p>If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), contact DRS directly to set up an Access Plan. DRS facilitates the interactive process that establishes reasonable accommodations. Contact DRS at <a href = "mailto: uwbdrs@uw.edu.">uwbdrs@uw.edu</a>.</p>
		<h3>For our veterans</h3>
		<p>Welcome! We at UW Bothell understand that the transition into civilian life can be challenging for our veteran students and we have many resources for any who may want to reach out for guidance or assistance. This includes our Vet Corp Member through the WDVA/AmeriCorp and our Student Veterans Association (SVA). Please contact Veteran &amp; Military Resources Office at 425.352.5307 or a <a href="mailto:rosal@uw.edu">rosal@uw.edu</a>. For those of you needing more URGENT support, please dial 988 and press 1 (<a href="https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/">https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/</a>). The phone number for <i>The Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1.800.273.8255</i>, or connect with the <a href= "https://www.uwb.edu/student-affairs/care-team">UWB CARE Team</a>.</p>
		<h3>Incompletes</h3>
		<p>A student who cannot complete a course is not automatically granted an Incomplete. University rules state that “an incomplete is given only when the student has been in attendance and has done satisfactory work until within two weeks at the end of the quarter and has furnished proof satisfactory to the instructor that the work cannot be completed because of illness or other circumstances beyond the student’s control.”</p>
		<h3>Inclement weather</h3>
		<p>Please check if the campus may be closed due to weather. If campus is closed, then we will meet online through a Zoom link posted on Canvas.</p>
		<p>Information on suspension of operations will be made public and available through the media, and are also available on the website or by calling the Campus Information Hotline 425.352.3333. You may also sign up with an alert system that will contact you via email or text message if classes are canceled. For more information, see <a href="http://www.uwb.edu/emergency">here.</a></p>

	<p> Dr. Price acknowledges that we live and work on the unceded, ancestral lands of indigenous people. For example, the UWB campus sits on the original territory belonging to the Willow (Sammamish) People. Let us thank them for the stewardship of this land. Let us pay our respects to elders past and present.</p>
