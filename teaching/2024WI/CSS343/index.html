		<p>This class is a general introduction to the practice of science, intended as an overview of the scientific
			process. You’ll learn by doing, working with real datasets to research the questions that you generate.
			Since I am a paleobiologist, we will use a database about fossils as our jumping-off point for immersing
			ourselves in the scientific process.</p>
		<p>This course is required for science students in IAS and is also open to others who are interested in
			scientific inquiry. You’ll learn approaches to communicating science, analyzing and presenting data, and
			reviewing literature.</p>

		<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
		<p> You can expect to learn approaches to data analysis, data presentation, literature searching and science
			writing that will be applicable to advanced science courses at UWB and to doing science in general. By the
			end of this course, you will demonstrate the ability to</p>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>conduct scientific research and assume a scientific identity. </li>
			<li>use statistics to analyze quantitative data, and present the results of your analyses in graphs and in
				words.</li>
			<li>located read, and understand primary literature about your research topic.</li>
			<li>adopt a collaborative approach to doing science, including conducting peer review by working with your
				classmates to exchange ideas, share resources, and review each other’s work.</li>
			<li>write a scientific paper that presents the results of your original, scientific research and that places
				your work in the context of primary literature from that discipline.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Is This Course for Me?</h3>
		<h4>Your background</h4>
		<p>This course is designed to provide an overview of how science works and emphasizes aspects of the scientific
			process that will serve science students in advanced courses. To benefit from this course:</p>
		<ol type=square>
			<li>You should have prior exposure to science courses, and thus a basic familiarity with scientific
				information, its presentation, and the process of scientific investigations.</li>
			<li>You should be comfortable with algebra, probability, and presentation of quantitative information in
				graphs and tables (and be able to interpret data presented in such forms).</li>
			<li>A prior course in statistics might be helpful, but it is not required.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Access to technology</h4>
		<p>Half of this course is online and therefore requires a reliable fast-speed Internet connection. The <a
				href="https://www.uwb.edu/it/training-and-support/teaching-learning/open-learning-lab">Open Learning
				Lab</a> and the <a href="https://library.uwb.edu/">library</a> can provide access on-campus if you need
			it. You also need to make sure that you know how to access the course using Canvas. If you are not familiar
			with Canvas, please visit the <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/875034">UWB Learning Technologies
				student tutorial page</a> (or just search: UWB Canvas students). We’ll be using Microsoft Excel to
			complete the statistical analyses for your research projects.</p>
		<h3>Context for this course in IAS</h3>
		<p>The <a href="https://www.uwb.edu/ias">School of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences</a> focuses all students’
			experiences around <a href="https://www.uwb.edu/ias/undergraduate/learning-objectives">five core learning
				objectives:</a></p>
		<ul type=square>
			<li>Collaboration and shared leadership</li>
			<li>Critical thinking</li>
			<li>Diversity and equity</li>
			<li>Interdisciplinary research and inquiry</li>
			<li>Writing and presentation</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These objectives apply across all areas of study and your experiences in every IAS course should allow you to
			develop your abilities and understanding in most, if not all, of the four objectives. This material and
			assignments in this course will help you in these topics.</p>

			<p> Dr. Price acknowledges that we live and work on the unceded, ancestral lands of indigenous people. For
				example, the UWB campus sits on the original territory belonging to the Willow (Sammamish) People. Let
				us thank them for the stewardship of this land. Let us pay our respects to elders past and present.</p>
