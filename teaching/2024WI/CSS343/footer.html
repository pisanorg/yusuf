        <p> Dr. Price acknowledges that we live and work on the unceded, ancestral lands of indigenous people. For
            example, the UWB campus sits on the original territory belonging to the Willow (Sammamish) People. Let
            us thank them for the stewardship of this land. Let us pay our respects to elders past and present.</p>
