## Research

[Research](research.html)

[CSS 497 Capstone](capstone.html) guidelines, advice and project ideas. Past[students](./people) I have supervised.


## Teaching

I have taught small classes, large (700-person) classes, first-year classes, graduate level classes, supervised masters and PhD students, experimented with hybrid and online classes, used traditional lecturing, active learning, flipped classrooms, collaborative meaning making and gamified classrooms. I received the [UTS Teaching Award](https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/awards-and-citations/past-award-and-citation-0) in 2006.

I have decided to make all my evaluations public to help future students make more informed choices, or at least know what they are getting into when they decide to take a course from me. It also is an interesting and fun historical record! Happy spelunking into my [teaching evaluations](teaching/evaluations/) going back for many many years.
